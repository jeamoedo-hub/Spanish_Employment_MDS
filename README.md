# Spanish_Employment_MDS
Analysis of employability in Spain using R, including data exploration, visualization, and statistical modeling to identify key factors that influence employment.

This project focuses on analyzing employability in Spain through a complete data analysis workflow in R. The project includes:

🔹 Data import, cleaning, and preprocessing

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): employment/unemployment rates, differences by age, gender, education level, and region

🔹 Visualization of labor market trends using ggplot2

🔹 Statistical and predictive modeling to identify the variables that most strongly influence employability

🔹 Interpretation and discussion of key insights regarding Spain’s labor market

This repository provides both the code and the analytical reasoning needed to understand labor dynamics in Spain from a data science perspective.
